The goal of this project is to create a bot that plays the game tusmo.xyz indefinitely.  
In order to not spoil the fun of other people, this bot is programmed to play on SOLO mode.

For that I used :
 - Python 3.10.5
 - Selenium
 - [geckodriver](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver) 0.31.0

Feel free to try it out !
